## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**
    ```sh
    npx playwright install
    ```

### Configuration

- **Test credentials:**  
  Update `tests/credentials.json` with the correct LMS URLs and user credentials.

- **Test settings:**  
  The test runner is configured in `playwright.config.ts`:
  - All tests run with a single worker (`workers: 1`) to avoid session conflicts.
  - Retries are enabled (`retries: 2`).
  - HTML reports are generated after each run.

### Running Tests

- **Run all tests:**
    ```sh
    npx playwright test
    ```

- **Run a specific test file:**
    ```sh
    npx playwright test tests/EVSU_LMS_INST_TEMPLATES.spec.ts
    ```

- **View HTML report:**
    ```sh
    npx playwright show-report
    ```

### Environment Variables

Some test files may require environment variables (e.g., `PW_SCRIPT`).  
To run a script with a specific variable:

```sh
PW_SCRIPT=EVSU_LMS_INST_TEMPLATES npx playwright test tests/EVSU_LMS_INST_TEMPLATES.spec.ts
```

## Test Organization

- **Login and Navigation:**  
  Automated login flows for instructor accounts.
- **Dashboard and Templates:**  
  Checks for UI elements, buttons, filters, and dashboard functionalities.
- **Screenshots:**  
  Screenshots are saved in the `screenshots/` directory for visual verification.

## Customization

- **Add new tests:**  
  Place new `.spec.ts` files in the `tests/` directory.
- **Change browser/device:**  
  Edit the `projects` section in `playwright.config.ts` to enable/disable browsers or devices.

## Troubleshooting

- **Session Logout Issues:**  
  Tests are run serially (`workers: 1`) to avoid session conflicts.
- **Timeouts:**  
  Adjust `timeout` and `actionTimeout` in `playwright.config.ts` if needed.
